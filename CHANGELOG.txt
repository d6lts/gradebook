Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-03-04
----------------------
* by MGN: Changed weight of gradebook submodules so they are greater (hooks are called after) gradebookapi.
* by MGN: Rewrote gradebook_attachments hook_user to remove database records and remove files when a users
  account is deleted.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-03-01
----------------------
* by MGN: restrctured new gradebook features into submodules gradebook_responses, gradebook_attachments,
  and gradebook_scales. All of these submodules are optional.  

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-02-25
----------------------
#383664 by MGN: Fixed permission typo: 'admin gradebook' is now 'administer gradebook'.
* by MGN: Added new feature to assign a student response type, and incorporate links to student
  responses on the gradebook_grade_form.
* by MGN: Added new feature to allow teachers to weight gradebook categories in their gradebooks.
* by MGN: Added new feature to allow teachers to create, edit and assign gradebook scales to assignments.
* by MGN: Additional themeing of the gradebook_grade_page to alert teacher and student of attachments
  and/or student responses.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-02-24
----------------------
#382254 by MGN: Fixed two file support bugs reported by bdangelo and madflute.
* by MGN: database modification: changed {gradebookapi_files} primary key to ('fid', 'nid'), 
  and make fid field NOT NULL (since its a primary key).

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-02-10
----------------------
* by MGN: Modified gradebook_list_page to show table only when there are two or more gradebooks. For
  one gradebook, bypass the list page altogether and go to the only option. And when the user is not
  affiliated wtih any gradebooks, a helpful message is displayed.
* by MGN: Fixed gradebook list page so only relevent gradebooks are shown to the user
* by MGN: Fixed width of earned and note fields

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-02-02
----------------------
* by MGN: Modified earned and possible fields in gradebookapi database tables to be of type float
  instead of int. This will make future grade conversions/scales easier to implement later
  and allows for fractional points now.
* by MGN: Implemented hook_block to provide a block that lists all the current assignments for a 
  student or teacher that will be due in the future. The list is sorted by gradebook and
  then by due date. The assignment titles are given, along with the total possible points 
  and the date due. The assignment title links to the assignment node.
* by MGN: To allow finer control over the date settings (hours and minutes), I implemented a date_popup 
  element from the date api. I don't want to require dateapi for this module, so its an 
  optional feature. On the gradebookapi admin screen there is a checkbox which will enable the 
  use of date_popup on the assignment forms. Leave it unchecked if you don't want it.
* by MGN: Added a custom date format element to the gradebookapi admin form. This optionally sets the 
  date format used in the assignment block and and on the gradebook page.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-31
----------------------
* #367150 by MGN: Added file attachments for gradebook entries for teachers and students. 
  This necessitated a new table gradebookapi_files, so its important to run update.php when 
  upgrading. Also, many changes to gradebookapi to load, remove and otherwise manage these 
  files. Added general gradebook configuration to allow students, teachers or both to attach files.
* #367154 by MGN: Fixed pager support for  gradebook pages with many assignments or edit forms 
  with many grade entries. Added general gradebook configuration of the number of grades to display 
  on a gradebook page.
* by MGN: Redesigned grade_assigment_page and grade_student_page to call the same gradebook_grade_form. 
  Less code to manage and a more consistent, uniform css-styled UI.
* by MGN: Changed the {gradebookapi_grade} 'earned' field so it can be null. This allows for grades to be 
  reset to null when the grade is edited, if desired. It was previously being reset to 0. This 
  also required a couple of minor changes to the gradebookapi_calc_grades function because earned 
  can be null even when $grade is not.
* by MGN: Updated README.txt to explain new features.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-20
----------------------
* #360414 by MGN: Added new feature to delete gradebook grades when account is deleted.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-1
----------------------
* by MGN: added access gradebook permission.
* #360407 by MGN: added export gradebook feature, borrowing heavily from the webform module. This 
  adds a menu local item to export the gradebook to Excel or text file. Most of the new code is in 
  two include file gradebook_report.inc and gradebook_export.inc. To avoid code duplication, 
  gradebook_gradebook_page() was modified to return rows for a text table when called with the 
  argument = TRUE.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-17
----------------------
* by MGN: rewrote hook_gradebookapi_teachers and hook_gradebookapi_students so creating a new drupal 
  role does not automatically give it teacher and student status. Also separated out common code into 
  a helper function _gradebook_gradebookapi_role to avoid code duplication.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-13
----------------------
* #358236 by MGN: incorrect use of url() in form redirect.

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-08
----------------------

----------------------
* Added two forms to improve UI: 
    * grade all students for a select assignment, and grade all assignments for a selected student
* Added div ID's for form elements to permit form layout through CSS (not yet implemented in gradebook.css)
* split off page callbacks into either gradebook.pages.inc (display/edit grade) or gradebook.category.inc
  or gradebook.category.inc (gradebook categories) to reduce size of gradebook.module
* reworked theme_gradebook_page and gradebook.css to improve css control of formating on gradebook_page
* Added assignment class average row to gradebook_page

Gradebook 6.x.2.x-dev, 2009-01-01
----------------------

----------------------

* Clarified documentation of students and teacher roles when using og_gradebook. 
* Allow sitewide student and teacher roles to be optional so it works correctly with og_gradebook.

Gradebook 6.x.1.x-dev, 2008-12-12
----------------------
* Added embedded help via hook_help() in gradebook and gradebookapi

Gradebook 6.x.1.x-dev, 2008-12-10
----------------------

* Separated out admin pages into .admin.inc files to reduce module footprint
